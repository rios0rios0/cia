description: "Review pull requests and diffs in cia — the preserved Delphi 7 system information collector with its custom minimal RTL — against the rios0rios0/guide standards, with extra weight on the custom `System/` runtime, the inline assembly utilities, and what the tool transmits. Use when reviewing a PR, a branch, or staged changes here."

# Code review — `cia`

`CIA` (Coletor de Informações Automático) gathers OS, CPU, RAM, disk, printer, network and device-change information on a two-hour timer and can post it over HTTP. It is unusual even by archive standards: it replaces the Delphi RTL with a minimal `System/` implementation and links pre-compiled ZLIB objects.

## When to use this skill

Use it whenever you are asked to review a pull request, a diff, a branch, or staged changes
in this repository — and before opening a pull request of your own, as a self-check. It is a
**review** skill: it produces findings, not commits.

## Source of truth

The canonical engineering standards live in the
**[rios0rios0/guide wiki](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki)**. This file is a
repo-tailored index into that guide plus the rules that only apply here. Precedence, highest
first:

1. This repository's `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` —
   they describe *this* codebase and its load-bearing invariants.
2. The **rios0rios0/guide** wiki — the shared standard.
3. General language idiom.

When the guide and a general convention disagree, the guide wins. When this file and the
guide disagree, the guide wins and this file should be corrected in the same pull request.

## How to run the review

1. **Establish the range.** Resolve the default branch with
   `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (strip `refs/remotes/origin/`; fall back to `main`),
   then read the diff with `git diff <default>...HEAD` and the file list with
   `git diff <default>...HEAD --name-only`.
2. **Read whole files, not just hunks.** A hunk cannot show a layering violation, a missing
   test, or a duplicated helper. Open every changed file in full, plus the files it imports
   from the layer below.
3. **Check the change set as a unit** — not only the code. A change that alters behaviour,
   configuration, or architecture is incomplete without its changelog entry and its
   documentation update, and that omission is a finding in its own right.
4. **Map every finding to a rule.** Each finding must name the rule it breaks and link the
   guide page (or the repository file) that states it. A comment that cannot be traced to a
   rule is a suggestion, not a defect — label it as such.
5. **Report, do not rewrite.** Produce the review in the output format below. Only edit files
   when the request explicitly asks for fixes.

## What matters most in `cia`

These are the checks that catch real defects in this repository. Work through
them before the generic ones.

- **`System/` is a hand-written replacement for the Delphi RTL.** `System.pas`, `SysInit.pas`, `SysSfIni.pas`, and `SYSWSTR.PAS` provide what the compiler normally supplies. A change there affects every allocation, string operation, and exception in the program — treat it as the highest-risk area in the repository and expect a clear justification.
- **The `.obj` files are pre-compiled ZLIB 1.1.4 C objects** linked at build time (`adler32`, `compress`, `crc32`, `deflate`, `inflate`, `infback`, `inffast`, `inftrees`, `trees`, `uncompr`), plus `installer.obj` and `asm.obj`. They are binaries: they cannot be reviewed, so a change that adds or replaces one needs its provenance stated explicitly.
- **`MyUtils.pas` implements `IntToStr`/`StrToInt` and more in x86 inline assembly.** Any change there needs the boundary values checked by hand — there is no test suite and no RTL to fall back on.
- **This tool collects and transmits host information.** `EthFuncs.pas` enumerates interfaces and MAC addresses and performs an HTTP POST. Any change that widens what is collected, or that changes where it is sent, is a **Critical** finding and needs to be stated plainly in the changelog — a hard-coded destination host especially.
- **Buffer handling is manual.** Winsock2 enumeration, registry reads, and string building all use fixed buffers; an unchecked length is an overrun in a program with no runtime protections.
- **`WM_DEVICECHANGE` handling and the two-hour timer are the program's shape.** Changing the interval or the message handling changes what the tool does; say so in the changelog.
- **Treat this as an archive** — discontinued in 2014. No modernisation, no framework, no reformatting.
- **`Clear.bat` defines build output** (`.dcu`, `.exe`, `.map`, …); none of it belongs in a commit.

### Commands a reviewer should be able to quote

```bash
# open CIA.dpr in Borland Delphi 7 and compile (Ctrl+F9)
Clear.bat
```

### YAML

See [YAML Conventions](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/YAML). The extension is `.yaml`, never `.yml`. String values are
single-quoted; double quotes appear only where interpolation or an escape needs them;
booleans and numbers are never quoted. This applies to workflows, compose files, manifests,
and YAML blocks inside Markdown.

## Tests

There is no test suite and no CI compile step. Verification is compiling in Delphi 7 and running the collector on a disposable Windows machine, then checking the emitted JSON against what the README documents.

## Documentation and change control

See [Documentation & Change Control](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Documentation-&-Change-Control) and
[CHANGELOG Formatting](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/CHANGELOG-Formatting).

This repository uses **chlog fragments**. `CHANGELOG.md` is generated and is never edited by
hand.

- Every change ships a fragment created with `chlog new --kind <Kind> --body "…"`, staged in
  the **same commit** as the code. Kinds: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
  `Fixed`, `Security`.
- A backward-incompatible change to the public interface additionally carries `--breaking`.
  The kind alone never triggers a major bump.
- A hand-edited `CHANGELOG.md`, or a code change with no fragment under
  `.changes/unreleased/`, is a **Critical** finding — `chlog check` fails the build for it.
- Fragment bodies start with a lowercase verb in simple past tense, capitalise proper nouns
  (GitHub, Go, Docker), and wrap code identifiers and versions in backticks.
- `README.md` is updated whenever usage, setup, configuration, or architecture changes;
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `CLAUDE.md` whenever the workflow, commands, or
  structure changes. Documentation and code ship in one commit.

## Git Flow and pull-request hygiene

See [Git Flow](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Git-Flow) and [Merge Guide](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Merge-Guide).

- Branch names are `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `test/`, or `docs/` followed by a
  ticket ID or a short slug — `feat/TICKET-000`, `fix/input-mask`.
- Commit subjects are `type(SCOPE): message`: simple past tense (`added`, `fixed`, `changed`,
  `removed`), lowercase first word, no trailing period, code identifiers in backticks.
- Branches are synchronised with `git rebase`, never `git merge`. A merge commit from the
  default branch inside a feature branch is a finding.
- Breaking changes are flagged in **three** places: the commit footer
  (`**BREAKING CHANGE:** …`), the changelog, and the pull-request description. One or two of
  the three is not enough.
- Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/): MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for
  features, PATCH for fixes.

## Security

See [Security](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Security).

- **No hard-coded secrets.** API keys, tokens, passwords, and private keys belong in
  environment variables or a secret manager — never in source, tests, fixtures, or the
  changelog. A secret that reaches a commit must be rotated, not merely deleted.
- **Never write a PEM header sentinel or a realistic key shape into a fixture**
  (`ghp_…`, `sk-…`, `AKIA…`, `xoxb-…`, JWT-shaped strings, or the dashed `BEGIN …` banners).
  Gitleaks matches the shape, not the value, so a placeholder that merely *looks* like a
  credential fails the pipeline. Use inert placeholders such as `fixture-token-placeholder`.
- **Suppressions must be justified.** Entries in `.gitleaksignore`, `.trivyignore`,
  `.semgrepignore`, or `.codeql-false-positives` need a fingerprint, a dated comment, and a
  reason. A suppression added to silence a real finding is a Critical.
- Validate and sanitise every external input; use parameterised queries; apply least
  privilege; keep secrets out of logs.
- Dependency manifest changes are reviewed for new transitive vulnerabilities. When a fix
  exists, bump the version rather than suppressing the finding.

## What not to flag

A review that raises noise gets ignored. Do not report these:

- Anything that amounts to "this is old code". Modernising idiom, renaming identifiers, reformatting, or introducing a framework into a preserved archive is out of scope and destroys the historical record.
- Mixed Portuguese and English identifiers and UI strings — that is the original code.
- The custom RTL existing at all — it is the point of the project.
- The absence of tests, linting, or a CI compile step.
- Anything the guide does not require and this file does not list, unless it is a genuine correctness or security defect — say so plainly and label it a Suggestion.

## Review output format

```
## Code review: <branch or PR>

### Critical (must fix before merge)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <what is wrong> — violates <rule> (<guide page or repo file>)

### Warning (should fix)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <what is wrong> — violates <rule>

### Suggestion (optional)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <improvement>

### Change-control checklist
- [ ] Changelog entry present for every behavioural change
- [ ] `README.md` updated if usage, setup, or architecture changed
- [ ] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated if the workflow, commands, or structure changed
- [ ] Commit messages follow `type(SCOPE): message` in simple past tense
- [ ] Breaking changes flagged in the commit footer, the changelog, and the PR description

## Severity

| Severity       | Use for                                                                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical**   | Broken dependency direction, a leaked secret, an injection or authentication flaw, a missing changelog entry, a banned mock library, a load-bearing invariant broken, a test deleted rather than fixed. |
| **Warning**    | Naming that departs from the guide, a missing test for a new branch of logic, an unexplained magic value, a stale README or instructions file, a `switch` that should be a map. |
| **Suggestion** | Readability, consistency with neighbouring modules, and performance ideas that no rule mandates.                                     |

Rank findings most severe first, and state plainly when nothing blocks the merge — an empty
Critical section is a valid, useful review.
